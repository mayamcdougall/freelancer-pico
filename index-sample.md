#     Freelancer is a free HTML theme created by Start Bootstrap and ported to PicoCMS for a streamlined and hassle free user experience. Using this theme in Pico, you can easily generate portfolio items by simply creating new markdown pages!
#     Your site's metadata provides tons of extra customization as well. You can specify your own avatar for the masthead, change the icons in the dividers, the social icons, and most of the text on the page all without touching the theme's code.
